# xerus - a general purpose tensor library    {#mainpage}

## Doxygen Documentation

This is the (automatically generated) Doxygen documentation for the `xerus` library. It is the only complete documentation (ie.
mentioning all classes and functions with at least a one-line description) but far less accessible than the documents of the
[main documentation](/documentation.html) or even the [examples](/examples.html).

It is advisable to use a modern IDE when working with any c++ source code, but in particular when using the `xerus` library. In 
which case all of the information of this documentation should also be available from within your IDE as mouse-over text or similar.
If your IDE does not provide this functionality consider switching to `kdevelop`, `clion` or a similarly advanced IDE.
