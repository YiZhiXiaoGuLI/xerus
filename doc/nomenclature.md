# Nomenclature

Tensor (Network) methods were developed independently in several different fields. As such there is a large variety of different
names for the same concepts and at times even several concepts for the same name, depending on the context.

To avoid confusion we want to explain the terms as they are used throughout this library. Unfortunately we are not aware of any 
introductory publication using our exact notation and nomenclature, but everybody familiar with the notation from Numerical Analysis
will be familiar with most definitions. We saw it necessary to expand these terms though to have precise names for every aspect.

Tensor, degree, dimension, mode, index, multi-index, position, span, slate, entry, (element - unused??), contraction, shuffling, 
TensorNetwork, Node, external link
TTTensor, TTOperator, rounding, core, cannonical form, component
