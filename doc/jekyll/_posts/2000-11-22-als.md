# Alternating Algorithms and Performance Data

__warnStart

This Chapter is still **work in progress**.
Currently missing are sections on:
* introduction to alternating algorithms
* usind ALS(_SPD), ASD, DMRG to solve least squares problems
* changing algorithm options via new algorithm objects
* using PerformanceData to log and / or output the progress of an algorithm
* defining own local solvers
