# Examples

Functional examples of library usage can help you to quickly gauge if it is the library you are looking for, can be very instructive
on how to practically use its capabilities and even serve as starting points for you own algorithms and programs. This is why
we think it is very important to make practical examples available with a library.

Naturally this section could (always!) use more examples. So please do not hesitate to send us any code you have written using the
`xerus` library, including comments and explanations, to [contact{at}libxerus.org](mailto:contact@libxerus.org).
