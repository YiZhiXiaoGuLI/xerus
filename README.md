The `xerus` library is a general purpose library for numerical calculations with higher order tensors, Tensor-Train Decompositions / Matrix Product States and other Tensor Networks.
The focus of development was the simple usability and adaptibility to any setting that requires higher order tensors or decompositions thereof. 

For tutorials and a documentation see <a href="http://libxerus.org">the doxygen documentation</a>.
